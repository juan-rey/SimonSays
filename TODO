Next Release:
* Add delete, rename/edit and reordering for categories/phrases directly in the UI (no registry edits required).
* Import/export phrase sets to/from files with language metadata and conflict-safe merges.
* Expand bundled sound effects and surface them in the phrase picker.

Upcoming Releases:
* Provide a global stop/cancel action that halts speech and inline sound playback immediately.
* Add ducking controls: raise TTS volume and temporarily lower other applications while speaking.

Long Term Goals:
* Support additional audio formats (MP3, OGG, etc.) with graceful fallbacks for unsupported codecs.
* Integrate eye-tracking (Windows Eye Control at minimum) to drive phrase selection and playback.
* Add pictogram support for phrases to aid users with AAC needs.
