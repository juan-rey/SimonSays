SimonSays – Simply Speak - ChangeLog
=========================================

Beta Releases
------------
2026-02-02 Version 0.3
   - Beta release with enhanced stability and usability.
   - New features:
     * Taskbar resilience: low-level mouse hook detects taskbar clicks and triggers Z-order recovery.
     * Faster Z-order polling when needed; stops automatically once restored.
     * Voice selection UI with language-specific voice filtering.
     * 12 new languages supported with localized default phrase sets.
     * Full localization of UI text in supported languages.
   - Fixes:
     * Resolved issues with sound playback timing and overlapping audio.
     * Improved error handling for missing audio files and unsupported formats.
     * UI enhancements for better accessibility and responsiveness.
   - Notes:
     * Continued refinement of registry management for multi-user environments.
     * Current supported languages: Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified), English, French, Galician, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Valencian.



Development Releases
------------------
2025-11-30 Version 0.2
   - Feature-rich development build (alpha -> early beta).
   - New features:
     * Added Italian and Portuguese default phrase sets and Sounds categories.
     * Default phrase installation API: `RegistryManager::InstallDefaultPhrases()` (programmatic).
     * Play pipeline: editor text is parsed by the SOUND_NOTE_DELIMITER. Segments are played in order:
       - Plain text segments are spoken with SAPI (synchronous).
       - Delimited segments are treated as audio file names and played via `PlaySound` (synchronous).
     * Sound support for common audio files (.wav, .mid/.midi) and inline sound markers in the edit control.
     * Expanded `REGISTRY_SETUP.reg` with more categories and frequency-sorted phrases for multiple languages.
     * Category window layout and theming improvements (dark/light taskbar detection, rounded corners).
     * Compact taskbar UI tweaks: play button state, centered edit font, multiline edit support.
   - Fixes:
     * Robust handling of unmatched delimiters and trimming of segments before playback.
     * Safer registry read/write with fallbacks to English defaults.
     * Minor stability fixes for voice object lifecycle handling.
   - Notes:
     * Alpha/beta still: expect incomplete voice-selection UI, limited localization of UI text, and no sync/import/export UX.
     * Registry changes are applied to HKCU only; importing system-wide settings requires elevation.

2025-11-13 Version 0.1
   - First release — proof of concept. (Alpha stage with basic functionality)
   - Features:
     * Taskbar-resident utility that converts typed text to speech using SAPI.
     * Quick-access categories and frequent phrases (multi-language registry-backed defaults).
     * Registry setup file (`REGISTRY_SETUP.reg`) with default phrase sets.
     * Basic language detection to pick phrase sets (English, Spanish, French, German, etc.).

2025-10-22 
   - Project initialization.
